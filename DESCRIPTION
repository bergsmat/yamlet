Title: Store Data Specification as YAML
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: A data specification is useful both for developing
 and documenting a data table.  \pkg{yamlet} checks whether a
 table-like object matches a YAML description, and optionally
 applies YAML metadata as data item attributes. Data and metadata
 are stored independently and optionally associated by naming
 conventions.  For compact representation, keys 'label' and 'guide' 
 are assigned by default to the first two anonymous values for 
 each named item. Defaults can be over-ridden by stored metadata
 or by function arguments.
