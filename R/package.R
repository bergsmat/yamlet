#' yamlet: Versatile Curation of Table Metadata
#'
#' The \pkg{yamlet} package supports storage and retrieval of table
#' metadata in YAML format.  The most important function
#' is \code{\link{decorate.character}}: it lets you 'decorate'
#' your data by attaching attributes retrieved from a file in
#' YAML format.  Typically your data will be of class
#' 'data.frame', but it could be anything that is essentially
#' a named list.
#'
#' @section Storage Format:
#'
#' Storage format for 'yamlet' is a text file containing
#' well-formed yaml.  Technically, it is a map of sequences.
#' Though well formed, it need not be complete, and therefore
#' has utility over a longer life cycle of data development.
#'
#' In the simplest case, the data specification consists
#' of a list of column (item) names, followed by semicolons.
#' Perhaps you only have one column:
#'
#' \code{mpg:}
#'
#' or maybe several:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' mpg:
#' cyl:
#' disp:
#' }
#'
#' If you know descriptive labels for your columns, provide them
#' (skip a space after the colon).
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' mpg: fuel economy
#' cyl: number of cylinders
#' disp: displacement
#' }
#'
#' If you know units, create a sequence with square brackets.
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' mpg: [ fuel economy, miles/gallon ]
#' cyl: number of cylinders
#' disp: [ displacement , in^3 ]
#' }
#'
#' If you are going to give units, you probably should give a
#' key first, since the first anonymous element is 'label'
#' by default, and the second is 'guide'.  (A guide can be
#' units for numeric variables, factor levels/labels for
#' categorical variables, or a format string for dates, times,
#' and datetimes.)  You could give just the units
#' but you would have to be specific:
#'
#' \code{mpg: [unit: miles/gallon]}
#'
#' You can over-ride default keys by providing them in your data:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#' mpg: [unit: miles/gallon]
#' _keys: [label, unit]
#' }
#'
#' Notice that stored yamlet can be informationally defective
#' while syntactically correct. If you don't know an item
#' key at the time of data authoring, you can omit it:
#'
#' \code{race: [race, [white: 0, black: 1, 2, asian: 3 ]]}
#'
#' Or perhaps you know the key but not the value:
#'
#' \code{race: [race, [white: 0, black: 1, asian: 2, ? other ]]}
#'
#' Notice that \code{race} is factor-like; the factor sequence
#' is nested within the attribute sequence. Equivalently:
#'
#' \code{race: [label: race, guide: [white: 0, black: 1, asian: 2, ? other ]]}
#'
#' To get started using yamlet, see \code{?as_yamlet.character} and
#' examples there. See also \code{?decorate} which adds yamlet
#' values to corresponding items in your data. See also \code{?print.ag}
#' which uses labels and guides to autogenerate axis labels.
